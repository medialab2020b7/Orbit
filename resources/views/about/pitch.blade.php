                <p>To connect people all over the world with the goal of helping each other. Maybe we don’t want to talk about our problems with someone we know, sometimes, a stranger’s perspective can be very helpful.
                    Also to visualize the connections that the internet and new technologies can create.

            <p>The platform communicates with a database to store users login information and data (name, location, etc.). We will be using the PostgresSQL database management system provided by the CICA at FEUP.
                The platform will be built using PHP for the communication and Javascript for the interactive interface.

            <p>Multi user platform in which a user can log into and contact another user through a message sent by email. The user can then see his/her connection in the 3D interactive globe on the main page. Other than his/her connection many other connections can be viewed in the globe. The user can choose which connections to see based on filters related to location of connections, date, etc.</p>
